# Evaluating Public Safety in Washington, D.C.

## Overview
Public safety is an extremely important aspect of cities, enabling residents to carry out their daily lives, from working to participating 
in community activities. To optimize the effectiveness of public safety, it is crucial that residents feel the police are doing an efficient 
job and are content with both the policing and the leadership of the city's police department. It is also important that public safety policies
reflect the needs of all residents, from newer arrivals to those who have lived in the city for over a decade. Overall, ensuring that residents
are satisfied with all aspects of public safety, particularly with the city's policing, requires residents to communicate their public safety needs
and the strategies they want to see implemented.

Recognizing the importance of public safety and effective policing, in 2017, the Washington D.C. Office of the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety and Justice 
conducted a survey that included both quantitative questions, such as those on the Likert scale, and qualitative open-ended questions, in which 
residents provided feedback on a wide range of topics related to the city's public safety, from experiences with police and police effectiveness to the 
qualities a police chief should possess. In total, over 7,000 responses were provided by residents, and there was flexibility for residents to take the 
survey either online or in person at locations such as recreation centers. The local government of Washington D.C. deemed the survey a major success, 
with Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington D.C., and her staff playing a pivotal role in promoting the significance of this survey.

This research utilized a variety of computational techniques to address the pressing public safety issues mentioned above, ultimately gaining more insights 
into how the Metropolitan Police Department can improve their approach to certain areas of public safety while also retaining strategies that are effective 
according to residents. Some of the causal inference techniques used included point-biserial correlation tests, chi-squared tests, and multivariate logistic 
regression with fixed effects. Additionally, natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as term frequencies, term frequency-inverse document frequency, 
sentiment analysis, and topic modeling, were used. Lastly, various data visualization techniques were implemented to effectively present the outputs of the 
causal inference and NLP techniques, as well as the results of other noteworthy summary statistics, to best display the main findings and takeaways.
